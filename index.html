        		<h1>Hello, I'm Monte Roybal!</h1>
				<p>I am currently a senior at <em>New Mexico Highlands University</em> pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Prior to attending NMHU, I served for five years in the <em>United States Marine Corps. </em>In the USMC, my military occupational specialty was 6492, PME Calibration Technician. I worked on the flightline closely with Aviation Electronics. It was my passion to pursue something in electonics after my service, and I chose CS! </a></p>
